            <p>Open-source community-driven database for tracking changes to political administrative
                boundaries.</p>
        </header>
        <p>Built by the <a href="https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries/graphs/contributors">community</a> and <a href="https://geolab.wm.edu">William & Mary geoLab</a>, the geoBoundary Tracker
            is an online database tracking how boundaries (i.e., state, county)
            change over time for every country in the world. We currently track approximately 1 million boundaries within over 200 entities,
            including all 195 UN member states. All boundaries are available to view or download in
            common file formats, including
            shapefiles;
            the only requirement for use is <a href="index.html#citation">acknowledgement</a>.

                <h3>Transparency & Research Replication</h3>
                <p>While many countries provide public domain information on where their boundaries are,
                    a majority do not provide an authoritative, open digital source. We strongly believe
                    that every global citizen should have access to information about the legal
                    political boundaries they live within, without having to pay for the access.</p>

                <h3>Precision & Consistency Matter</h3>
                <p>Small shifts in legal boundaries can drive huge changes, but are rarely tracked or
                    recognized. We collate or create the highest geographic precision open data possible
                    to promote precise results, and keep all of our previous versions available online.
                    geoBoundaries has been around since 2017, providing annual updates each year. </p>

                <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
                <p>Every one of our boundaries is available as a Shapefile and geoJSON, with globally
                    unique identifiers and consistent attributes. We provide both manual download and
                    API access to support most users preferred mode of access.</p>
