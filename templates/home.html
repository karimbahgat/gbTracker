            <p>Open-source community-driven database for tracking changes to political administrative
                boundaries.</p>
        </header>
        <p>Built by the <a href="https://github.com/wmgeolab/geoBoundaries/graphs/contributors">community</a> and <a href="https://geolab.wm.edu">William & Mary geoLab</a>, the geoBoundary Tracker
            is an online tool and database tracking and reconstructing how boundaries (i.e., state, county)
            change over time for every country in the world. We currently track approximately 1 million boundaries within over 200 entities,
            including all 195 UN member states. All boundaries are available to view or download in
            common file formats, including
            shapefiles;
            the only requirement for use is <a href="index.html#citation">acknowledgement</a>.

                <p>
                    In some cases, we may not know the exact depiction of what a boundary 
                    looked like, but perhaps we have a <b>text-based source</b> telling us that
                    on some date a boundary underwent a change, like <b>changed its name, 
                    split up, or merged</b> with another boundary. By combining this information
                    with other data points, we can reconstruct the boundary delineation before or 
                    after the reported change.

                <p>
                    Uploading boundary data and associated temporal metadata 
                    helps by providing an "anchor point" or a <b>snapshot</b> of what a set of
                    boundaries looked like <b>at a given point in time</b>. This is useful
                    to reconstruct how boundaries have changed over time.

                <p>
                    If boundary data is not available, additional information can be sought from
                    maps that depict country boundary outlines at a particular point in time. 
                    Digitizing or extracting <b>map boundary outlines</b> helps to turn this information
                    into useful boundary snapshots.

                <h3>Transparency & Research Replication</h3>
                <p>While many countries provide public domain information on where their boundaries are,
                    a majority do not provide an authoritative, open digital source. We strongly believe
                    that every global citizen should have access to information about the legal
                    political boundaries they live within, without having to pay for the access.</p>

                <h3>Precision & Consistency Matter</h3>
                <p>Small shifts in legal boundaries can drive huge changes, but are rarely tracked or
                    recognized. We collate or create the highest geographic precision open data possible
                    to promote precise results, and keep all of our previous versions available online.
                    geoBoundaries has been around since 2017, providing annual updates each year. </p>

                <p>Every one of our boundaries is available as a Shapefile and geoJSON, with globally
